Microsoft Team's `Incoming webhook` connector allows you to publish messages to teams channel.

You can even add actions to the content so that users can complete tasks within the channel.

## Adding Webhook Connector to a Channel

In Microsoft Teams, choose the `More options (â‹¯)` button next to the channel name in the list of channels and then choose Connectors.

Add `Incoming webhook` connector to the channel.

Now choose `configure` button next to the `Incoming Webhook` connector.

Provide a name and upload an image for the connector. Now select `Create` button.

Copy the webhook URL for later reference.

We have now set up the webhook for the channel.

## Sending Messages to Webhook

To send a message to the webhook connector we have to send it as a JSON payload. Refer [message card template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference) on how the payload needs to be structured.

You can experiment your card design at [Card Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net/).

We will send below sample payload to the connector and check if it works.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/HarshadRanganathan/5c169170e6d883f58d0af109773ea56b.js"></script>

Send this JSON payload as a POST request to the Webhook URL. 

You can either use `Send via WebHook` option available in the [Card Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net/) (or) [Postman](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/actionable-messages-via-connectors#send-the-message) to send the message to the webhook.

## Sending Messages to Webhook from Jenkins Build

You can make use of the [office 365 connector plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+365+Connector+Plugin) to send build messages to the webhook. 

However, if you want to send a custom message as part of your jenkins job then we can't make use of this plugin.

Below is a sample which sends a custom card message to the webhook using `httpRequest` step in [jenkins pipeline code](https://rharshad.com/jenkins-pipeline-as-code/).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/HarshadRanganathan/adfcb576ff8509220a46a398932211bc.js"></script>

This card shows the build parameter values with an action button to view the build job.
