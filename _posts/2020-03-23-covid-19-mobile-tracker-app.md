There has been a lot of scare-mongering and panic regarding Covid-19 due to constant publication of new infections count on a daily basis.

So, I thought why not create an app that focuses only on this aspect to reduce the mental stress induced on people (albeit there are already quite a few websites which provide affected, deaths and recovered counts but I wanted to focus only on the recovered count and remove other stressful data).

So, I ended up creating an android app that provides information on the number of people who had recovered from Covid-19 infections across the world.

Additionally, the app also shows time series chart to visualize the number of people recovered over a period of time.
